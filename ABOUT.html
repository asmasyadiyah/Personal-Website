<p><font style = "Arial">Assalamualaikum and hello to everyone, I hope you guys have a great day for today. Please don't forget to start your day with a smile on your face and give one compliment to yourself :).
Okay so let me start with introducing myself first on this page. I am Asma Syadiyah, preferably called Asma. My hobbies are watching youtube, sleeping, eating, and listen to a songs these things are the things that I always do in my leisure times. I currently live in Putrajaya with my loving family. I am 20 years old, I was born on 8 August 2002. Actually, I was born at Sandakan, Sabah so yeah I am "orang Sabah bah" HAHAHAHA. But, right now I do not really remember all the dialects from Sabah because it has been a long time since I visited Sabah, so I lost all the dialect and accent from Sabah. So please don't ask me to speak in Sabah cause I don't really remember it that much, sorry. Moving on, let me tell you a little bit about my family, there are 6 members including me. Which is, my father, my mother, my brother, my sister, my younger brother and me. I am the third child out of four siblings. Just want to share with you guys that it is very hard being a middle child like seriously. Nonetheless, whatever circumstances there were, I really LOVE my family.It is so hard to be apart with them but it's fine to leave your home, family and bed just to finish your study at the college  and also to gain more knowledge. I am really looking forward to staying and studying at campus UiTM Arau, Perlis ^_^.

<p><font styles = "Arial">Next, let me tell you guys a bit more about myself. I am a Computer Science student at UiTM Arau,Perlis, a diploma student. Right now I am in four out of five semesters. I also didn't really believe that I would manage to go this far on this diploma journey. Actually, I didn't really like things about computers because I am really bad at it but then when I received the UPU result  I could hardly cannot believe  that I was offered a Computer Science course at UiTM Arau, Perlis. At first, I really thought that it was just only a dream but it is not. Actually, my first choice in the UPU  was “Early Childhood Education” but I did not get it. It is a bit sad and frustrating but I did not give up and took the offer thinking that it was a good challenge for me to face. And to be said, I think I did a great job in facing that challenge.</font></p>

But please don't really hope too much:’(. In a nutshell, I am very sorry if I have talk in a rude ways or display a bad manners or also gives a wrong information. I apologise about it. Alright, I hope to see you guys next time, goodbye.</p></font>
